## C++ and Data Structures 
# linked List
A linked list is a data structure in which elements, called nodes, are connected in a linear sequence. Each node consists of data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists can be singly linked (each node points to the next node) or doubly linked (each node points to both the next and previous nodes).

# Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a data structure where each element, known as a node, contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The linked list starts with a head node, and the last node typically points to a null reference.

## Uses of Singly Linked Lists
1. **Dynamic Data Storage**:Singly linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation, allowing for efficient memory usage when the size of the data structure is not known in advance.
1. **Insertions and Deletions**:Singly linked lists excel at insertions and deletions of elements, as they require updating the links between nodes without the need to shift elements in memory.
1. **Traversal**:Singly linked lists are suitable for linear traversal and are often used in algorithms where sequential access to data is required.
1. **Stack and Queue Implementation**:Singly linked lists serve as the basis for implementing stacks (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out) and queues (FIFO - First-In, First-Out).

## Advantages of Singly Linked Lists
1. **Dynamic Size**:Singly linked lists can grow or shrink as needed, making them suitable for applications with varying data sizes.
1. **Efficient Insertions and Deletions**:Insertions and deletions at any position in the list are efficient, as they only require updating references.
1. **Linear Access**:Singly linked lists support efficient linear access, allowing for traversing and searching data sequentially.
1. **No Wasted Memory**:They allocate memory as needed, avoiding memory waste and fragmentation.
1. **Basis for Other Data Structures**:Singly linked lists serve as a foundation for implementing more complex data structures, such as stacks and queues.
